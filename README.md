**What is this**

This is a docker image to display the aquarium terminal fistank.  Reason I made this is to practice creating docker images. 

The guide I followed for installing the fish tank can be found at https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-unix-apple-osx-terminal-ascii-aquarium.html

Special thanks to RoboBunny https://robobunny.com/wp/ for providing the ascii 

**To do**

Figurate out how to make a name for the docker image... 

    REPOSITORY                     TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
    <none>                         <none>    eae33f2473c6   5 seconds ago   176MB

Is a bit repulsive.
